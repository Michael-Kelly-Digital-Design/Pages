                <p>The installation is aimed at getiing our young excited about the scale of the WCTU's great civic acheivement. Having participants walk along the physical length of the petition is a good way of demonstrating the physical size of the petition;
                    which in turn is an intuitive way to give an idea of this feat's magnitude</p>

                <h3>The Game</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <p>The AR game will place a virtual representation of the original rolled up petition into the world. The participants will swipe at it on their device's screen to roll it away from them, then walk to catch up with it. This process will repeat,
                    and have the user chasing the petition for it's entire length. The petition will take all of a 270m walk to unroll, and will span from the doors of the National Library to the steps of parliament. The roll will follow a set path as
                    it travels. As it has to cross two roads to reach it's destination, the app will have safety features to ensure the petition doe not lead it's pursuers into traffic. The game will feature a ticker which renders the names listed on
                    the petition as it unfurls, as rendering them in the world space on the roll would be far too graphically intensive</p>
